At my prior place of employment, I wrote a rather bespoke script that formatted their monthly lease invoice to their exact specifications.

It relies on a lot of info being in the database being pulled from and cannot function without it.

Again, it's a bespoke solution that was one of my small projects that I'm proud of.
